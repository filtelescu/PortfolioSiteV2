                <h2 style="color: #f5f5f7;" class="project-info-header-two">Creating a Seamless Office Rental Experience</h2>
                <p class="p-readable thirty-two-spacing mobile-spacing-lul">The goal of this project was to create a unique and easy way to both book and rent office space, as well as to book meeting rooms while in the office space itself. Our team (including myself, Fahim Shahriar, and Nicholas Chan) completed the entire design process from research all the way to high-fidelity designs, and will continue to further develop this app/service throughout the next few months.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #f5f5f7;" class="project-info-header-two">The Current State of Co-Working Spaces</h2>

                <p class="p-readable thirty-two-spacing mobile-spacing-lul">Before we began designing it was important to research what currently exists in order to identify problems, as well as the direction we wanted to go in. After spending some time visiting various co-working spaces we were able to clearly identify problems and start working towards designing a product. Note: The middle point on the image below is our product, bookable.</p>

                <p class="p-readable thirty-two-spacing">After my team and I designed the app screens, I took the Sketch file into Principle and animated them for testing and our first promo video. Principle is an awesome tool for animating screens and is one of my personal favourite softwares to use when designing!</p>
